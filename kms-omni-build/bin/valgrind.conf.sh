# Default settings for Valgrind commands.
#
# This config file acts as a central place where all Valgrind settings can
# be defined. This allows to have a common set of general settings.
#
# The environment variable VALGRIND_ARGS gets created as an array of strings,
# containing all command-line options that should be passed to the Valgrind
# command.
#
# To use this file, source it and expand the VALGRIND_ARGS array:
#
#     source valgrind.conf.sh
#     valgrind --tool=memcheck "${VALGRIND_ARGS[@]}" ./my-program

    # Detect self-modifying code.
    # Needed for JIT languages, like Qt's QML interpreter.

    # "--smc-check=all"

    # Read debug info about inlined function calls.

    # Control the scheduler used to serialise thread execution.
    # Improves reproducibility of thread scheduling for multithreaded applications,
    # which is particularly helpful when using Helgrind or DRD.
    # SPEED WARNING: If CPU scaling is enabled, this could decrease significantly the
    # performance of a multithreaded app. Prevent that by disabling the system's
    # CPU scaling mechanism. E.g. with `cpufreq-set`:

    # ================
